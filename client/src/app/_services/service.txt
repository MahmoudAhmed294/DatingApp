Features of Angular Services:
Services in Angular are simply typescript classes with the @injectible decorator.
 This decorator tells angular that the class is a service and can be injected into components that need that service.
As mentioned earlier, these services are used to share a single piece of code across multiple components.
 These services are used to hold business logic.
Services are used to interact with the backend.
