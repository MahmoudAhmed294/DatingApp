Interceptors:
 in Angular, as the name suggests, is a simple way provided by the framework to
intercept and modify the applicationâ€™s http requests globally before they are sent to the server.
That really comes in handy, allowing us to configure authentication tokens , add logs of the
requests, add custom headers that out application may need and much more.
